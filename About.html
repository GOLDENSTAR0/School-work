      <p>I want to present my business as a sort of a Gallery of the projects and commissions I did as requested. The sort of art as traditional art, digital, wallpapers or even small video edits. As a student, is also hard to balance my work and my business at the same time, however, I am open to feedback and whatever type of advience from my costumers.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="p2">
      <p2>The main rule and philosophy is the commun respect between costumer and saler, if this rule unfortunately is not followed, the costumer gets blocked and never having any sort of communication.</p2>
